However, the importance comes with how the person left the bike. The bike was chained to the post with a fancier chain than the ordinary $5 one from Walmart which indicated a certain amount of wealth. The helmet was simply clipped to the side and things were left in the basket which implies a certain amount of trust in the area. I never saw the owner come back for her bike and even otherwise I wouldn’t be able to guess if she was a resident nearby. However, the bike itself was very indicative.
